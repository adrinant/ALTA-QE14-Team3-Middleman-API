# 🚀 Alta Capstone
# Middleman API Automation Testing

## 🎯 About the Project

This project is an automated testing project for the Middleman Apps using Cucumber, Serenity BDD, and RestAssured. GoRest is
an API service used for testing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources such as users, posts,
albums, and more. The primary goal of this project is to ensure that the API endpoints work as expected, validate the
responses, and verify the correctness of the data returned by the API.
